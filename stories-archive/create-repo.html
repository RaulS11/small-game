<h1>Create a repo</h1>
<p>Naturally I thought on comparing the three major repos. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket.</a>
I skimmed an <a href="">article</a> that compared all those up. I was getting more inclined for GitLab
while reading it, even though that it say that GitHub had many more users.
I also looked at <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/">Bugcrowd's Bug Bounty list</a> for all of them. It turned out that GitLab
did not offer any money so, I had to look at the other's prizes and <a href="https://bounty.github.com/">GitHub</a> offers plenty more.
While <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/atlassian">Atlassian</a> caps at 5k, GitHub caps at 30k. So I guess that's the one I'm gonna pick.
I mean, I did get my GitHub's account hacked once.</p>
